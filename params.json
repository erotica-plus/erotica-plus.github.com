Assurance that the erotica found on the site is not a replica of pornography(transcripts).\r\n\r\n2. No funding is to come from or lead to the porn industry in any way(advertisement).\r\n\r\n3. Creating an environment that dissuades immoral behaviour or anything mimicking of(kinks,under age fetishes,racial stereotypes and so on.)\r\n\r\n* Creating a user environment that does not cater to one gender and take from the other.This challenge consists of:\r\n\r\n1. Dissuading sexist behaviour in the community which consists of externalized hatred or self hatred.\r\n\r\n2. Alienating genres such as BDSM,Rape/Non-Consent,MILF and so on..\r\n\r\n3. Encouraging open mindedness in the community..\r\n\r\n4. Educating users on harmful \"sexual\" themes that involves the pain of another being.\r\n\r\n5. Creating female only spaces where they will be free to talk about their sexual fantasies  without men leading the discussion.\r\n\r\n* Encouraging the free flow of communication/literature that leads to a better understanding of the sexual nature of the complementary sexes.This consists of:\r\n\r\n1. Focusing on male/female artists separately.\r\n\r\n2. Rejecting content that enforces gender expectations and literature which replicates porn scenes.\r\n\r\n3. Creating an easy to use chat platform, which is to be moderated by community oriented people.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
